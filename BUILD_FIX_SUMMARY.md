# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cargo.toml Edition Issue ✅
**Problem**: Edition was set to "2024" which doesn't exist
**Solution**: Changed to "2021" (latest stable edition)
**File**: `Cargo.toml`
```toml
# Before
edition = "2024"
rust-version = "1.85"

# After
edition = "2021"
rust-version = "1.70"
```

### 2. Java Code Generator Unused Imports ✅
**Problem**: Unused imports causing potential warnings
**Solution**: Removed unused imports (Rule, Element, Alternative, LexerCommand, HashSet)
**File**: `src/codegen/java.rs`
```rust
// Before
use crate::ast::{Grammar, Rule, Element, Alternative, LexerCommand};
use std::collections::HashSet;

// After
use crate::ast::Grammar;
```

### 3. Missing Exports in lib.rs ✅
**Problem**: New code generators (Go, C, C++, Java) and GrammarComposer not exported
**Solution**: Added exports to public API
**File**: `src/lib.rs`
```rust
// Added exports
pub use codegen::{GoCodeGenerator, CCodeGenerator, CppCodeGenerator, JavaCodeGenerator};
pub use analysis::GrammarComposer;
```
