# Security Audit Checklist for minipg

This document outlines security considerations and audit checklist for the minipg parser generator.

## Overview

minipg is a parser generator that processes grammar files and generates code. Security considerations include:
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Memory safety (Rust provides this by default)
3. Denial of Service (DoS) protection
4. Code injection prevention
5. Dependency security

## Security Checklist

### Input Validation

- [x] **Grammar file parsing**
  - Parser handles malformed input gracefully
  - No panics on arbitrary input (verified by fuzzing tests)
  - Error messages don't leak sensitive information
  
- [x] **Character class validation**
  - Validates character ranges
  - Handles Unicode safely
  - Prevents regex injection in character classes
  
- [x] **String literal parsing**
  - Handles escape sequences correctly
  - Prevents buffer overflows
  - Validates string boundaries

- [ ] **File path handling**
  - Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
  - Validate file extensions
  - Limit file sizes to prevent DoS

- [ ] **Generated code validation**
  - Ensure generated code doesn't contain executable shell commands
  - Validate that action code is properly sanitized
  - Prevent code injection in target language generation

### Memory Safety

- [x] **Rust guarantees**
  - All code written in Rust (memory safe by default)
  - No unsafe blocks (verify with `cargo audit`)
  - Bounds checking on all array accesses

- [ ] **Stack overflow protection**
  - Limit recursion depth in parsing
  - Limit grammar nesting depth
  - Add tests for deeply nested structures

- [ ] **Heap memory limits**
  - Monitor memory usage with large files
  - Add memory limits for large grammar processing
  - Test with GB+ input files

### Denial of Service (DoS) Protection

- [x] **Parser robustness**
  - Handles arbitrary input without crashing
  - Fuzzing tests verify no panics
  - Property-based tests cover edge cases

- [ ] **Resource limits**
  - Timeout for parsing operations
  - Memory limits for code generation
  - File size limits (configurable)

- [ ] **Infinite loop prevention**
  - Detect and prevent left recursion (already implemented)
  - Limit backtracking in generated parsers
  - Timeout mechanisms

### Code Injection Prevention

- [ ] **Action code validation**
  - Sanitize action code in grammar files
  - Validate action code syntax for target language
  - Prevent execution of arbitrary code

- [ ] **Template injection**
  - Ensure code generation templates are safe
  - Validate all user-provided strings before template substitution
  - Escape special characters in generated code

- [ ] **Dependency injection**
  - Validate all imported grammar dependencies
  - Prevent circular imports that could cause issues
  - Sanitize imported grammar content

### Dependency Security

- [ ] **Regular dependency audits**
  - Run `cargo audit` regularly
  - Update dependencies with security fixes
  - Minimize dependency tree

- [ ] **Dependency versions**
  - Pin dependency versions in Cargo.lock
  - Review new dependency additions
  - Prefer well-maintained crates

### Authentication & Authorization

- [x] **Not applicable**
  - minipg is a library/tool, not a network service
  - No authentication or authorization needed

### Data Privacy

- [x] **No sensitive data handling**
  - minipg processes grammar files only
  - No user data collection
  - No network requests

### Error Handling

- [x] **Proper error handling**
  - All functions return Result types
  - Errors contain context but not sensitive information
  - No stack traces in production builds

- [ ] **Error message security**
  - Ensure error messages don't leak file paths
  - Don't expose internal implementation details
  - Sanitize user input in error messages

### Generated Code Security

- [ ] **Target language security**
  - Validate generated code for each target language
  - Ensure generated parsers don't introduce vulnerabilities
  - Test generated parsers for security issues

- [ ] **Code generation safety**
  - Escape special characters appropriately
  - Prevent injection attacks in generated code
  - Validate all code generation templates

### Testing & Validation

- [x] **Fuzzing**
  - Property-based testing with proptest
  - Fuzzing tests for parser robustness
  - Coverage-guided fuzzing setup (cargo-fuzz)

- [ ] **Penetration testing**
  - Test with malicious grammar files
  - Test with extremely large files
  - Test with malformed input

- [ ] **Security regression tests**
  - Add tests for known vulnerabilities
  - Maintain test suite for security issues
  - Regular security audits

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Regular Audits**: Run `cargo audit` before each release
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Code Review**: Review all code changes for security implications
4. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive security test suite

### Release Process

1. **Pre-release checklist**: Complete security audit checklist
2. **Dependency audit**: Run `cargo audit` and fix issues
3. **Fuzzing**: Run extended fuzzing sessions
4. **Review**: Security review of changes

### Incident Response

1. **Vulnerability reporting**: Provide clear reporting mechanism
2. **Response time**: Commit to response within 48 hours
3. **Patch releases**: Quick turnaround for critical fixes
4. **Communication**: Clear communication about security issues

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Status

- ✅ Memory safety guaranteed by Rust
- ✅ Input validation in parser
- ✅ Error handling with proper types
- ✅ Fuzzing tests in place
- ⚠️ File size limits not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Timeout mechanisms not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Action code sanitization needs review

### Future Improvements

1. Add configurable resource limits (memory, time, file size)
2. Implement timeout mechanisms for parsing
3. Enhanced action code validation
4. Security-focused code generation templates
5. Automated security testing in CI/CD

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in minipg, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: Report to project maintainers (see repository)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature
3. **Disclosure**: Wait for maintainer response before public disclosure
